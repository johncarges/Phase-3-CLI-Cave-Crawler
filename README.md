## Introduction

Welcome to Cave Crawler! You play as an intrepid explorer, setting out to discover
treasure and document the strange creatures that inhabit the underground. On one 
particularly bad day, you wake up unconscious in a cave and must navigate your way 
through the maze-like cave, battle enemies, and discover powerful treasure if you 
wish to see the sun again.

## Gameplay
- Players will encounter treasure, enemies, and rooms with forking paths.
- Smart decisions must be made, if you wish to survive! Should you fight this Griffin
    now, or retreat and hope to find a stronger sword? A treasure chest might contain 
    a better sword, or a potion - but it also might contain a foul poison! Are you 
    feeling greedy?
- As you encounter new enemies, they will be unlocked in your logbook. There, you can 
  view their stats, and log which enemies you've successfully defeated.
